Bike Website with AI Chatbot â€“ Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive bike information and recommendation platform that includes an AI-powered chatbot. The website is designed to help users explore various bike models, get details, check availability, and receive personalized suggestions. The integrated chatbot provides intelligent responses to user queries related to booking, pricing, engine types, brands, and more using NLP and ML models.

Project Goals

- Provide users with an easy-to-use interface to explore and compare bikes.
- Integrate an intelligent chatbot that can understand and respond to user queries.
- Use NLP techniques to identify user intent and extract entities from natural language queries.
- Suggest bikes to users based on budget, engine type, brand preference, and availability.
